## Introduction

In this course, we will learn how to use R to analyze and visualize data in the form of graphs, networks and trees. We will cover the following topics.

1.  What is a graph, network and tree?

2.  Their applications in biomedical research

3.  How to use R to analyze and visualize them

## Preparation

We need to install some R packages before the class.

Some packages are in Bionconductor, so we need to install `BiocManager` first.

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)){
install.packages("BiocManager")
}
```

## Preparation

`tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science, and it includes `ggplot2`, which is a basic graph package for network and tree in R.

```r
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)){
install.packages("tidyverse")
}
```

## Preparation

Some specific packages for graph, network and tree analysis.

```r
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("ggraph")
install.packages("tidygraph")
install.packages("ggnetwork")
BiocManager::install("ggtree")
BiocManager::install("treeio")
BiocManager::install("ggtreeExtra")
```

## What is a graph?

A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges (links) that connect pairs of nodes.

A small undirected graph with numbered nodes.
